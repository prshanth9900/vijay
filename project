Build a project on python based on web scraping
Steps:
Install Required Libraries: Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Request the webpage
url = 'https://example-news-website.com'
response = requests.get(url)

# Step 2: Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Step 3: Extract the data
# For example, let's say we want to get article titles and URLs
articles = []

# Assuming the articles are within <article> tags, update according to the structure of the site
for article in soup.find_all('article'):
    title = article.find('h2').text  # Adjust to correct tag
    link = article.find('a')['href']
    articles.append({'Title': title, 'URL': link})

# Step 4: Save the data to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(articles)

# Step 5: Export to CSV
df.to_csv('news_articles.csv', index=False)

print('Data has been saved to news_articles.csv')
